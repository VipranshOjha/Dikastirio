## 🏛️ Motivation



The justice system is moving online, but **current e-courts rely on video calls**, which strip away solemnity, create cognitive overload, and make evidence handling clumsy.



**Dikastirio** was born to solve this. Our vision: a **virtual courtroom where technology enforces decorum, streamlines proceedings, and safeguards integrity.**



---



## ⚡ What We Built



**Dikastirio** combines:



* A **VR courtroom** that restores spatial awareness and gravitas.

* An **AI agent, Themis**, that orchestrates the entire hearing.

* **Real-time transcription & evidence handling** designed for the legal domain.



Unlike video calls, Dikastirio is not just a communication platform — it’s an **active procedural manager** for justice.

## 🔑 Key Features



✅ **Immersive VR Courtroom** – A realistic digital courtroom with judge, lawyers, witnesses.



✅ **AI Agent "Themis"** – Manages flow: calling witnesses, administering oaths, logging adjournments.



✅ **Verbatim Transcription** – Real-time legal-grade transcription using **Gnani.ai**.



✅ **Interactive Evidence Display** – Present PDFs, videos, and images via simple voice commands.



✅ **Automated Records** – Themis generates structured, legally compliant session summaries.
